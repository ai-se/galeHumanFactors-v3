We advocate exploring complex models by combining data miners (to find a small set of most critical examples) and of multi-objective optimizers (that focus on  those critical examples). 
An example of such a combination is the GALE optimizer that intelligently explores thousands of scenarios by examining just a few dozen of the most informative examples.  
GALE-style reasoning enables a very fast, very wide-ranging exploration of behaviors, as well as the effects of those behaviors' limitations.

We show that, using CDA+GALE, it is possible to
identify and mitigate  factors that make pilots unable to complete
all their required tasks in the context of
different (1) function allocation strategies, (2)~pilot cognitive control strategies, and (3)~operational contexts that  impact and safe aircraft operation.
We also show that other optimization methods can be so slow to run 
that, without GALE,
it might be impractical to find those mitigations.

\section{Introduction}
There are many advantages of a model-based approach to human factors. 
Traditional human-in-the-loop (HITL) experimental case-studies are expensive, time consuming, and difficult to reproduce.
Model-based conclusions, on the other hand, are reproducible and verifiable (just run the model again).
Another advantage of the model-based approach is that models can simulate abstracted
real world behavior much faster than real-time;
thereby enabling an extensive evaluation of more options than would be possible with HITLs.

In theory, complex models can be analyzed via multi-objective optimizers by running them across many 
central processing units (CPUs). 
In practice, that CPU may not be available.
For example one of us regularly analyzes a model that needs 30 weeks of CPU time. 
For high priority issues in need of urgent resolution, then this 30 weeks of computer time can be achieved in five days of parallel execution on NASA's supercomputers.
However, in practice  researchers can usually access a small fraction of that CPU.  


To address this problem in other domains, we have proposed an optimization method, called GALE~\cite{krall14aaai,krallphd,galepaper},
that  focuses on a small number of most informative examples.
Hence, GALE explores only a few dozen examples rather than the thousands (or more) used  by traditional methods~\cite{galepaper,krall14aaai}. 
This simplifies and improves our ability to reason about complex cognitive models.

In practice, GALE runs much faster than traditional optimizers. 
Standard optimization algorithms such as NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast} require 3000 to 5000 evaluations to explore the pilot simulator that is the focus of this paper. 
GALE, on the other hand, performs the same task using 25 to 50 evaluations~\cite{krallphd}.
In practice, this has tremendous practical implications.
When generating conclusions from a randomizing optimizer such as GALE or NSGA-II, it is important to check that the conclusions hold in multiple repeats (say, 20 repeats). 
This number of evaluations is a critical indicator of runtime in optimizers when the model is complex.
For example, a study of the pilot simulator (replicated 20 times)
takes 1.5 and 100 hours for GALE and NSGA-II, respectively~\cite{krallphd}.





The algorithms behind GALE have been presented previously~\cite{krall14aaai,krallphd,galepaper}.
 Those prior reports  focused on runtimes and did not explore the analysis implications of GALE.
The core contribution of this paper is a case study on how GALE-style reasoning assists 
in the analysis of
work to support the design of complex operational concepts involving human operators and automated systems. This paper considers a simulation framework designed to investigate function allocation schemes early in the operational concept design process (CDA~\cite{Kim2011,Pritchett2011,Feigh2012,Kim2013,Pritchett2013}) 
and explores in detail how GALEâ€™s conclusions relate to the effect of function allocation strategy, pilot cognitive control strategy, and operational context impact and safe aircraft operation within the context of that model. 
As shown in \tion{lfm}, (1)~GALE offers  novel insights into complex cognitive models; (2)~other methods would be so slow to run that it might be impractical to find those insights without GALE.


The rest of this  paper is structured as follows.
An effective search of the models requires the utilization of automated tools such as the multi-objective objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) discussed in \tion{lfm}.
These models are intricate and take time to run. 
One such MOEA is our GALE tool discussed in \tion{cpu} which, in \tion{case} is applied to a simulation
of pilots flying an automated aircraft under different function allocations.
We show that GALE can provide insight into research questions like:
\begin{itemize}
\item RQ1:  Given a limited maximum human task load capacity, what are the effects to safety assurance when a pilot's workload exceeds his or her capacity?
\item RQ2:  What are the effects of changing how much pilots rely on automation?
\item RQ3: What are the effects of changing pilot policies for monitoring and overlooking flight procedures? 
\end{itemize}






\section{Motivation}\label{sec:mot}


Mitigation for human-automation interaction errors on the flight deck consists primarily of defining concepts of operation in which the roles and responsibilities of the pilots and of the automation are clearly laid out.
As a result, there is research on using models of human-machine interaction in conjunction with technologies such as model-checking ~\cite{Bolton2011,Rungta2013,Gelman2014} and simulation~\cite{Kim2011,Pritchett2011,Feigh2012,Kim2013,Pritchett2014,Feigh2014} at the time of automation design. 
For example, researchers at Georgia Tech~\cite{Kim2011,Pritchett2011,Feigh2012,Kim2013,Pritchett2014,Feigh2014} have developed the WMC (Work Models that Compute) framework.  

\subsection{Work Models that Compute}


Work Models that Compute (WMC) is a simulation framework, implemented in C++, for modeling and simulating concepts of operation that involve different function allocations between human operators and their automation. 
WMC work models are representations of the work a team of human and automated agents need to perform to accomplish the objectives of a concept of operation. The representations of work, or work models, are defined by resources and actions (and functions). Resources describe
the state of the work environment and actions
are the processes by which resources, and thus
the work environment, are accessed and
modified. Related actions can be aggregated into functions characterizing work serving a specific set of operational objectives.

Agent models in WMC specify the behaviors of an agent in handling taskwork. A basic agent in WMC is able to process actions assigned to it, execute those actions instantaneously, and report the time of action execution. A human performance agent is tailored to be able to address analyzing impacts of human limitations. For example if an action is counted as a unit of capacity for the human agent, the human can get overloaded and may delay actions, or interrupt them for higher priority actions. They may even forget actions altogether.

A human performance agent also may have different degrees of control over a situation. The opportunistic cognitive control mode is defined as ``the case in which the next action is chosen from the current context alone and mainly based on the salient features rather than durable goals or intentions''~\cite{Hollnagel1993}. The agent operating selects the next action in response to assessments that are driven by salient features in the environment. The tactical cognitive control mode is defined as the case in which ``the personâ€™s event horizon goes beyond the dominant needs of the present, but the possible actions considered are still very much related to the immediate extrapolations from the context''~\cite[p170]{Hollnagel1993}. Agents are guided by rules or patterns of behavior. The strategic cognitive control mode is defined as the one where ``the person is using a wider event horizon and looking ahead at higher level goals...''~\cite{Hollnagel1993}. The agent plans actions.

To investigate function allocation, work is assigned to agents. A specified invocation of work models and agent models comprise a scenario, and an analyst may test different function allocations and agent parameterizations for the same scenario through scripts.

\subsection{Continuous Descent Approach}

One concept of operation that has been investigated is optimized descent, also known as continuous descent approach (CDA).
WMC's  simulation models the physics of flight and the atomic actions of the pilots and the automation, in the context of prioritization schemes.

%\begin{comment} XXX
%Using
%For example, 
%CDA stands for Continuous Descent Approach.  CDA is actually an alternative approach (also called Optimized Profile Descent) %to the standard descent.  Details on that are given first in a brief background section, and then details about the model %are given thereafter.
%\end{comment}

CDA can understood by contrasting it with another landing tactic, the {\em standard descent}.  
In a standard descent, an aircraft must descend via several steps, requesting a new clearance at every step.  
As a consequence, flight times are longer and more fuel is burned.  
As the aircraft reroutes and encircles an airport before a runway is clear to land on, these wait times equate to more noise for the city.
Additionally, it is harder to fly at lower altitudes due to changes in the atmosphere and wind environments.

By contrast a {\em continuous descent approach} is a continuous non-stepped descent in which only one request for landing is needed.  
This simplifies the communication overhead between radio towers and pilots, and avoids extended duration at low altitude.  
As a result, a continuous descent can more accurately approach the runway, less fuel is burned, and less noise is emitted into the city.  
\fig{cda_diagram} illustrates the difference between CDA and traditional landing methods.

 



%\begin{figure*}
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/cda_diagram.png}
%  \caption[Continuous Descent Approach Diagram]{Diagram of Continuous Descent Approach (CDA).  The smoother red line %represents the CDA route, while the  green stepped line represents the traditional approach.  Note that the traditional %approach is closer to the city, so the city hears the noise emitted from the aircraft, whereas the red CDA line is further %away from the city, so that there is less noise for the city.}.
%%  \label{fig:cda_diagram}
 

%CDA is made possible with satellite technology called RNP (Required Navigation Performance).  That satellite positioning %technology allows the pilot to fly the aircraft very precisely to very narrow deviation from the commanded flight course.  %Often in standard descent, the pilot will deviate off course for minutes without noticing, and the time needed to return %back on course burns extra fuel, and makes flight more expensive. 

%During approach to runway, the RNP technology allows the aircraft to precisely know where it is at, so that a stepped decent %is no longer necessary.  Without the RNP technology, the pilot would need to take smaller steps to minimize any deviations.
%As another example, consider the case where the airport is just at the base of a cliff at the south.  When the aircraft %approaches the airport from the north, traditionally, it would have to fly a huge detour around the airport and approach %from the flatter north because of the cliff.  With RNP technology for a continuous descent approach, the aircraft can %approach from the north, and descend directly despite the presence
%f the cliff.



\section{Learning From Models}\label{sec:lfm}


For analyzing complex models like the WMC representation of CDA, we prefer GALE to traditional  optimizers since those optimizers require certain simplification assumptions.
For example, if models are simple continuous equations, then they could be readily explored with gradient descent methods such as the Quasi-Newton method (perhaps using the BFGS update rule recommended by Sims~\cite{Sims10}).
However, all such gradient descent methods assume that the model being explored is essentially continuous. 
Models like CDA are not continuous since their internal state space is divided into one combination of each branch of each {\em if statement} in the code~\cite{Davies2012}.



A better approach for exploring complex models is a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). 
There are many such optimizers including GALE and more traditional tools such as NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast}.
MOEAs assume that the model is a function that converts  {\em decisions} ``$d$'' into {\em objective} scores ``$o$''; i.e.
\[
o = \mathit{model}(d)
\]
In this framework, each pair $(d,o)$ is an {\em individual} within a {\em population}. 
MOEAs try to find a range of good inputs by progressively improving the population using the {\em generational} approach of  \fig{moea}.
Note that MOEAs  make no assumptions about model continuity (e.g. unlike the Quasi-Newton methods, they do not assume that models have local smooth gradients). 
They can also explore trade-offs between goals (see the domination predicate discussed in \fig{moea}). 
As discussed below, MOEAs have problems with {\em brittleness} and {\em CPU}.


%% MOEAs approach avoids tricky problems such as local maximia 
%% via the use of random mutation (see  step 3 of \fig{moea}).
%% Also, they can be applied to models non-numeric values and non-continuous
%% internal state spaces.
%% Better yet, the {\em domination predicate} used in culling worse solutions (see step 2 of \fig{moea})
%% can  explore intricate trade-offs between competing objectives.

%% When execte
%% Learning strategies for models are search tools that require for the model to be integrated into a "MOO-format"; i.e. decisions and objectives must be defined.  The decisions are simply the inputs to the model by which the search tool attempts to make meaningful conclusions.  The objectives are outcomes from the model that are defined as goals to maximize or minimize; the search tool will then attempt to find combinations of inputs that optimize those output objectives.  Since most models are multi-objective as opposed to single-objective, there is an added challenge to optimization because typically multiple objectives conflict with each other, e.g. maximizing one objective tends to minimize another.  Hence, the ultimate goal of search tools is to discover a trade-off curve called a Pareto frontier.  For example, the green plot markers from~\fig{amus} visually shows the Pareto frontier for data regarding London Ambulance deployment.

%% \begin{figure*}
%%   \centering
%%   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/amus.png}
%%   \caption{Exploring options for configuring London Ambulances~\cite{veer11} (to minimize $X$ and maximize $Y$).  An SBSE optimization algorithm has rejected thousands of options (shown in red)  to isolate clusters of better solutions C1,C2,etc (shown in green).}
%%   \label{fig:amus}
%% \end{figure*}



%% Cognitive models are meant to run more quickly than human-in-the-loop experiments, but they still take time to run.
%% The CDA model originally defined in Kim's Ph.D. thesis divides its input space 144 ways, each of which requires a separate simulation~\cite{Kim2011}. 
%% In our exploration, we further subdivide the maximum human taskload to evaluate 252
%% combinations. 
%% Worse yet, a detailed reading of Kim's thesis shows that these 144 input sets actually
%% explore only one variant each for three of her inputs~\cite{Kim2011}. 
%% Other modes would need to be explored to handle:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Unpredictable rerouting;
%% \item Different tail wind conditions;
%% \item Increasing levels of delay.
%% \end{itemize}
%% If we give three ``what-if'' values to the above three items then, taken together, these 3*3*3*252 modes*inputs would require nearly 7000  different simulations.
%% This is an issue since, using standard multi-objective optimizers such as NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast}, our models take seven hours to reach stable minima.
%% Hence, using standard technology, these 7,000 runs would take 292 weeks to complete.  
%% \ADD{Note that this complaint applies not only to NSGA-II but to all the other optimizers listed above.}

\begin{figure}[!b]

\begin{tabular}{|p{.95\linewidth}|}\hline
An evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOEA) requires at least two  operators:
{\em cull} and  {\em perturb}:
MOEAs generate an initial population by randomly selecting decisions then {\em culling} the individuals with the lower objective scores.
A new population $P_n$ is generated by {\em perturbing}  the decisions of the surviving individuals (e.g. via random mutation or grafting together parts of the decisions of different individuals).
MOEA's halt when $P_n$ scores no better than prior generations $P_{m<n}$.


One way to implement the culling (step 2) is via {\em domination}; i.e. remove one example
if it can be shown that it is worse than (a.k.a. ``is dominated by'') some other examples. 
Two forms of domination are {\em binary} and {\em continuous} domination.
In {\em binary domination},  one individual $x$ dominates $y$ if all of $x$'s objectives are never worse than the objectives in $y$ but at least one objective in solution $x$ is better than its counterpart in $y$; i.e.
\[ \begin{array}{c}
\left\{ 
     \forall o_j  \in \textit{objectives}\;\mid\; \neg ( o_{j,x} \prec o_{j,y}) \right\} 
\\
 \left\{
\exists o_j \in \textit{objectives} \;\mid\; o_{j,x} \succ y_{j,y}\right\}
\end{array}
\]
 where ($\prec,\succ$) tests if an objective score in one individual is (worse,better) than in the other individual.

An alternate culling method is  the {\em continuous domination} predicate~\cite{Zitzler04indicator-basedselection}  that
favors $y$ over $x$ if $x$ ``losses'' least:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cdom}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\textit{worse}(x,y)& =& \textit{loss}(x,y) > \textit{loss}(y,x)\\
\textit{loss}(x,y)& = &\sum_j^n -e^{\Delta(j,x,y,n)}/n\\
\Delta(j,x,y,n) & = & w_j(o_{j,x}  - o_{j,y})/n
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where  ``$n$'' is the number of objectives and $w_j\in \{-1,1\}$ depending on whether
we seek to maximize goal $x_j$.  
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.}\label{fig:moea}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Brittleness}

Ideally, any insight we glean from a model is not ``brittle''; i.e. it is a conclusion that is robust in the face of minor changes to model inputs.
Unfortunately, experts in MOEA reasoning caution that many MOEAs generate ``brittle'' decisions.

According to Harman~\cite{harman01}, understanding the neighborhood around individual solutions is an open and pressing issue:
\begin{quote}
 ``It may be better to locate an area of the search space that is rich in fit solutions, rather than identifying an even better solution that is surrounded by a set of far less fit solutions.''~\cite{harman04}.  
\end{quote}

He argues that many software model problems are {\em over-constrained}; i.e.  no precise solution over all variables is achievable.  
Such over-constrained problems are usually explored using heuristic search methods such as the MOEA of \fig{moea}.
The results of such partial heuristic search may be ``brittle''; i.e., small changes to the search results may dramatically alter the effectiveness of the solution~\cite{harman04}.  
 One way to check for brittleness is to use {\em neighborhood perturbation}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Cluster}  a  population into local neighborhoods;
\item  Build a new population by {\em perturb}ing the decisions in each neighborhood;
\item Halt if objectives do not change after perturbation;
\item Else, go to step 1.\end{enumerate}
One reason we endorse the GALE algorithm for reaching conclusions from complex cognitive models is that it directly implements neighborhood perturbation.



\subsection{Problems with CPU}\label{sec:cpu}
CDA is a complex model with many input parameters. 
The input parameter space for such models tends to grow very large so there is a pressing and urgent need for efficient modeling techniques.

The primary design criteria for standard MOEAs is ``ability to explore complex trade-offs'' and not runtime speed.
While the internal details of standard MOEAS may be very different (see \fig{sample}); most of them share one key characteristic:
they evaluate $O(2N)$ examples (twice the population size because they generate offspring which are perturbations of their parent examples) for each generation.  One reason we advocate GALE is that it replaces
 $O(2N)$ with a much faster $O(log_2N)$ technique (see below).


\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{|p{.95\linewidth}|}\hline
\small
\bi
\item NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast} 
uses a non-dominating sort procedure to divide the solutions into {\em bands} where {\em band}$_i$ dominates all of the solutions in {\em band}$_{j>i}$ (and NSGA-II favors the
least-crowded solutions in the better bands).
\item
{\em SPEA2}: favors solutions that dominate the most number of other solutions that are not nearby (to break ties, it uses density sampling)~\cite{zit02}; 
\item {\em  IBEA}:
uses continuous dominance to find the solutions that dominate all others~\cite{Zitzler04indicator-basedselection}; 
\item In {\em Particle swarm optimization} (PSO), a {\em particle}'s velocity is `pulled' towards the individual and the community's best current solution~\cite{pan08};
\item 
The {\em many-objective optimizers} are designed for very large numbers of objectives~\cite{deb14}; 
\item
Multi-objective {\em differential evolution} (DE): members of the frontier compete (and are possibly replaced) by candidates generated by extrapolation from any three other members of the frontier~\cite{storn97,5601760};

\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\small
\begin{tabular}{|p{.95\linewidth}|}\hline
GALE initially builds a population of points by selecting
decisions at random. 
It then {\em clusters} those decisions into neighborhoods as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Find two distant points in that population; call them the {\em east} and {\em west} poles. 
\item 
Draw an axis of length $c$ between the poles. 
\item
Let each point be at distance $a,b$ to the {\em east, west} poles.
Using the cosine rule, project each point onto the  axis  at $x=(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)/(2c)$.  
\item 
Using the median $x$ value, divide the population.
\item
For each half that is larger than $\sqrt{N}$ of the original population, go to step 1.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the above requires a distance measure between sets of decisions: GALE uses the standard case-based reasoning measure defined by Aha et al.~\cite{aha91}. 
Note also that GALE implements step 1 via  the FASTMAP~\cite{Faloutsos1995} linear-time heuristic:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Pick any point at random; 
\item Let {\em east} be the point furthest from that point; 
\item Let {\em west} be the point furthest from {\em east}.
\end{itemize}
These final sub-divisions found by this process are the {\em neighborhoods} that
GALE will {\em perturb} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Find the objective scores of the {\em east, west} poles in each neighborhood.
\item 
Using the continuous domination predicate of \fig{moea}, find  the {\em better} pole. 
\item
Perturb all points in that neighborhood by pushing them towards the better pole, by a distance  $c/2$ (recall that  $c$ is the distance between the poles).
\item
Let generation $i+1$ be the combination of all pushed points from all neighborhoods.
\end{itemize}
From a formal perspective, GALE is an active learner~\cite{Dasgupta2005} that builds a piecewise linear approximation to the Pareto frontier~\cite{Zuluaga:13}.
For each piece, it then pushes the neighborhood up the local gradient.
This  approximation is built in the reduced dimensional space found by the FASTMAP  Nystr\"om approximation to the first component of PCA~\cite{platt05}.
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Inside GALE}\label{fig:gale}
\end{figure}

GALE combines (a) the neighborhood perturbation (described above) with (b)~the MOEA algorithm of \fig{moea}.
The algorithm reflects over a {\em population} of points, each of which contains {\em decisions} (some inputs to a  model).
It then searches for the input decisions that lead to best outcomes.
For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item
if we adjust the inputs to the model for (say) high tailwind conditions...
\item
... then GALE can report the best monitoring policies for the cockpit instrumentation.
\end{itemize}

\fig{gale} lists the procedure by which GALE clusters the data into neighborhoods, then perturbs each neighborhood.
In terms of monitoring for brittleness, the key point of GALE is that  this process continues until the perturbations stop having any new effect (i.e. they stop generating better objective scores). 
That is, all GALE solutions are guaranteed not to be brittle.


Also, in terms of reducing runtime, the key feature of GALE is that, unlike traditional MOEAs such as NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast}, GALE does not evaluate its entire population.
Instead, as it recursively clusters the data in two (using steps 1,2,3,4,5 in \fig{gale}), GALE only computes the objective scores for the two most distant points in each division.  
This means that this binary division of the data terminates after just $log_2(N)$ comparisons of evaluated individuals. 
This is much less than the $2N$ evaluations required by  traditional methods like NSGA-II.

Note that the above is a very brief description on GALE. For a full description including algorithms, download sites, and results
from dozens of models, see \cite{galepaper,krallphd}.

\section{A Case Study:  CDA and GALE}\label{sec:case}

This case study was designed after reflecting on the following.
Sometimes, when monitoring cockpit instruments, a pilot is unable to complete all required tasks, which  can have adverse consequences on aviation safety.
It can occur for many reasons, including fatigue, or
 unexpected or stressful situations.
\subsection{Goals}

The goals of this study are:
\be
\item
To automatically discover the implications of lack-of-attention within WMC's CDA model;
\item
To learn what mitigations exist (if any) for reducing the problems associated with this lack-of-attention.
\ee
\ADD{We use interrupted, forgotten, and delayed tasks within the CDA model as an incomplete proxy for a safety metric.
Our possible mitigations are restricted to the input of our CDA problem space.}


\subsection{Methods}
\subsubsection{Apparatus}

 
The CDA work model implemented in WMC is a model of pilot interactions.
CDA employs a continuous descent approach to a runway. 
As aforementioned, a continuous descent is an alternative to the standard approach to a runway.
A continuous descent approach is arguably much more efficient in terms of a) fuel economy and cost, b) noise, and c) flight duration.

CDA is packaged within the WMC (Work Models that Compute) suite.  
As mentioned, human performance agents in WMC have a ``maximum human task load" variable which describes how much they can handle.  
If the task load is too large, then some of the workload will not be completed in time, or worse yet, might go forgotten entirely.  
We use the metrics that describe these problems as the output objectives for GALE, i.e., the dependent variables which are detailed in the subsection just below.

Also as mentioned, human performance agents in WMC may employ different cognitive
control strategies to alleviate the problems of large task loads.   
By studying the different strategies in terms of the output objective scores (the dependent variables), it is possible to understand the safety implications of different strategies and to learn what mitigations might exist (and can be exploited for safety gain).


\subsubsection{Independent Variables}

A CDA ``problem instance'' defined within the WMC framework consists of four decisions and five objectives.  
The CDA implementation itself within WMC contains many other inputs (for example, the flight path and aircraft type are fixed) but for the purposes of this study, they are held constant. 


%\begin{changed}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \textbf{HTM}: maximum human task load. This value describes how many tasks (where a task is an atomic action) can be maintained in a mental to-do list by a person.  Tasks in the model are assigned a duration and a priority. For a thorough description of this variable, please see~\cite{Kim2011}. When the number of necessary tasks exceeds the number of tasks that the person can maintain, there can be incurred delays, errors, or the possibility of the task being forgotten and lost.
%\item \textbf{FA}: function allocation.  This variable refers mainly to the relative authority between the human pilot and the avionics, and is discussed in more detail to follow.
%\item \textbf{CCM}: contextual control mode of pilots. These describe the pilots' ability to apply patterns of activity in response to the demands and resources in the environment, and are described in detail below.;
%\item \textbf{SC}: the  air environment  scenario.  WMC's CDA model includes four different arrival and approach scenarios.
%\end{enumerate} 
%\end{changed}

{\em a) Maximum human task load (HTM)}.
This value describes how many tasks (where a task is an atomic action) can be maintained in a mental to-do list by a person.  Tasks in the model are assigned a duration and a priority~\cite{Kim2011}. When the number of necessary tasks exceeds the number of tasks that the person can maintain, there can be incurred delays, errors, or the possibility of the task being forgotten and lost.

{\em b) Function allocation (FA)}.  This variable refers mainly to the relative authority between the human pilot and the avionics. FA defines the different
ways the pilots can configure the autoflight controls.

\bd
\item[{\bf Highly Automated:}] The computer processes most of the flight instructions directly; the pilot only confirms the clearances. This function allocation addresses a possible future concept of operation.
\item[{\bf Mostly Automated:}] The pilot processes the instructions and programs the autoflight system, but then the autoflight
system controls the flight path automatically. This mimics current lateral ``LNAV" and vertical ``VNAV" flight navigation operations.
\item[{\bf Mixed-Automated:}] The pilot processes the instructions and programs the computer to handle the lateral flight path. The flight crew uses a lower level of automation for the vertical profile, including the altitude, vertical speed, and airspeed.
\ed

{\em c) Contextual control mode  (CCM)}. These describe the pilots' ability to apply patterns of activity in response to the demands and resources in the environment. These are based on Hollnagel's work on representative patterns of activity~\cite{Hollnagel1993}:
\bd
\item[{\bf Opportunistic:}] Pilots monitor and perform tasks related to only the most critical functions (monitoring is conducted only when necessary to complete assigned taskwork).
\item[{\bf Tactical:}] Pilots cycle through most of the available monitoring tasks, and double check some of the computer's tasks (periodic monitoring checks are conducted).
\item[{\bf Strategic:}] Pilots cycle through all of the available monitoring tasks, and try to anticipate future tasks.
\ed

{\em Scenario (SC)}.
WMCâ€™s CDA model includes four different arrival and
approach scenarios. The four arrival and approach scenarios (SC) implemented within the CDA model are: 
\begin{description}
\item[Nominal:] (ideal) arrival and approach.
\item[Late Descent:] controller delays the initial descent.
\item[Unpredicted rerouting:]  pilots  directed to an unexpected waypoint.
\item[Tailwind:] wind  pushes  plane from  ideal trajectory.
\end{description} 

 
%    \be

%\end{changed}


\subsubsection{Dependent Variables}

CDA's five objectives  keep track of how many tasks were delayed, interrupted or forgotten entirely (which impacts the relative safety of the flight itself)~\cite{Kim2011}. 
Better pilot organizational structures can be found by exploring different inputs of CDA to optimize these goals so that safety is improved:
\begin{description}
\item[Num Forgotten Actions:] tasks forgotten by the pilot. When the number of tasks expected of the pilot exceed the HTM, tasks with the lowest priority are `forgotten'.
\item[Num Delayed Actions:] number of delayed actions. Tasks have a scheduled time and a duration.  When a higher priority task causes another task to begin later than its scheduled time, it is `delayed'.
\item[Num Interrupted Actions:] interrupted actions. A higher priority task can cause a lower priority task to be interrupted.
\item[Interrupted Time:] time spent on  interruptions.
\item[Delayed Time:] total time of all of the delays.
\end{description}
%\begin{changed}
%\be
%\item \emph{Num Forgotten Actions}: tasks forgotten by the pilot. When the number of tasks expected of the pilot exceed the HTM, tasks with the lowest priority are `forgotten'.
%\item {\em Num Delayed Actions}: number of delayed actions. Tasks have a scheduled time and a duration.  When a higher priority task causes another task to begin later than its scheduled time, it is \em{delayed}.
%\item  \emph{Num Interrupted Actions}: interrupted actions. A higher priority task can cause a lower priority task to be interrupted.
%\item  {\em Interrupted Time}: time spent on  interruptions.
%\item \emph{Delayed Time}: total time of all of the delays.
%\ee
%\end{changed}

\subsubsection{Experimental Design}

In  the following, CDA was run for varying and decreasing values of HTM.
For each HTM value, we collect:
\bi
\item {\em The  baseline objective scores} seen in CDA. 
\item {\em The treated objective scores} seen in CDA. These treatments are learned
by GALE and represent the best case actions that could be performed by pilots
to mitigate against the lack-of-attention problem.
\ei

When analyzing CDA, GALE was run using  parameters found to work best on several other models~\cite{krallphd}:
\bi
\item GALE uses a population of size 100;
\item GALE must  terminate after a maximum number of 20 generations;
\item GALE may terminate if no improvement is seen in any objective in the last three generations;
\ei
To control for random effects during optimization, all scores are the mean values of 20 repeated runs of {\em baseline} or  the model {\em treated} with GALE's conclusions.

\subsubsection{Data Analysis}
We  compare {\em baseline} and {\em treated} by letting GALE select any inputs across the full range of all CDA input values.
 
That first experiment found a curious threshold effect: underneath a certain HTM point, all the best decisions concerned a particular contextual control mode.  
In  {\em Opportunistic} mode, pilots monitored and performed tasks related to only the most critical functions in the cockpit. 
That is, in this mode, pilots executed only the most essential monitoring actions according to the CDA model (e.g. monitoring altitude and monitoring descent airspeed), and focused primarily on adjusting the lateral profile.  
 

To  understand the impact of this {\em Opportunistic} mode, a followup  
experiment   was conducted,  with the {\em Opportunistic} mode  disabled.

\subsubsection{Sanity Checks}
We define two  sanity checks on our results:

{\em Sanity check \#1:}
 As we 
{\em decrease}
HTM (maximum human task load), we should see {\em increasing} adverse flight operations. 

{\em Sanity check \#2:} Using CDA and GALE, we can find mitigations that reduce the effects of decreasing HTM. 
If this were otherwise, that would suggest that MOEAs like GALE are not useful here.



%% To expand on that last problem, Krall comments~\cite{krallphd} that models can be very slow to optimize even if the model just a few hundred milliseconds per run.  The CDA model requires about 6-8 seconds of runtime per run, so that last problem can become a very serious issue (and it is).  Thousands of runs at those runtimes can take several hours, and worse yet, engineers at NASA Ames want to repeat this process for hundreds of different scenarios (different tailwind conditions; different frequencies of how often ground control demands course changes, etc).  It is estimated that by using standard methods, and running on one CPU (as opposed to parallel processing), that those runs would take six years of calendar time to complete.

%% Although possible to reduce that runtime complexity with parallel processing, recently in~\cite{galepaper}, Krall et al. have been exploring a more efficient approach to reduce the number of model runs, called GALE (Geometric Active Learning Evolution).  Standard tools take a Monte Carlo approach to studying complex models.  That approach requires generating populations (of size $N$) of candidate inputs to the model, and then in each iteration of the tool, running the model $2N$ times (an $O(2N)$ order of complexity).  The data mining approach of GALE on the other hand, analyzes the input population structure to find the most informative subsets of candidates, and only runs the model with those selected candidates (which number just a few dozen, usually).  Thus, GALE only requires at most $2log_2(N)$ model runs per iteration, and usually requires fewer iterations that Monte Carlo methods as well.

%% GALE is essential for the task at hand in this paper.  Previously in~\cite{krall14aaai}, GALE was compared to standard methods that took 3-5 hours per run whereas GALE only needed 6-20 minutes; that study was only for one single mode of CDA.  In this paper, 16 different modes of CDA are explored.  It would require a year of calendar time alone just to explore CDA with two other standard methods.  GALE on the other hand reduces that time requirement to 83 hours, a reduction factor of just over 100 times less.

%% This paper stresses that the contribution here is not GALE, but rather the methodology in approaching cognitive studies for aircraft research.  Previously in~\cite{krall14aaai}, a subset of this paper appeared and only one mode of CDA was explored.  This paper is an extension of that previous work which explores many more models as made possible only through the application of GALE. 

%% The key takeaways from this paper are a follows.  A
%% trend in the cognitive limitations of pilots has
%% been identified.  In that trend, whenever cognitive
%% limits have been exceeded, the key is to let
%% automation take over most of the operation.
%% \todo{misty can comment on these next statements ->}
%% Much of the aircraft operations community has
%% commented on the effect of over-reliance of falling
%% back on automated operations.  If pilots often
%% switch to automated modes during off-nominal
%% situations, then they do not receive the training
%% and experience necessary in the case when automated
%% modes are disabled or non-operational.  Poorly
%% trained pilots in those cases have been the subject
%% of many safety failures and disasters in the past.
%% Hence, the identification of this trend may be an
%% alarming one to the community: humans should be the
%% last fail-safe during flight operations.  This line
%% of thought is elaborated in the next section on
%% motivation and related work.




%% Much of the MOO literature has focused on optimizing simple math models, such as Fonseca~\cite{Fonseca95anoverview}, Schaffer~\cite{Schaffermodel}, Osyczka2~\cite{osymodel} and many others, which consist of simple mathematical transformation functions (which map independent variables to dependent variables, i.e. the inputs and outputs) as opposed to complex algorithms for simulation.  Conceptually, there is no difference in technique for optimizing those models.  However, math models are extremely fast to evaluate and inputs can be mapped to outputs in less than a millisecond as opposed to several seconds.  Hence, much of the MOO literature was able to run the models as often as possible with no penalty to the overall runtime for learning.  In other models where the behavior cannot be modeled via math, the model evaluation-times are often hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds long.  Thus, the search tools that typically evaluate the model thousands to millions of times can incur very large penalties to runtime.  For CDA, which is several seconds long, it is not possible to evaluate thousands of times unless thousands of processor hours are available to exploit - even so, lengthy runtimes can be impractical to work with.

%% Recently, we have been exploring a data mining approach to search tools which evaluates the model far fewer times than the standard methods, called GALE (Geometric Active Learning Evolution)~\cite{galepaper},\cite{krallphd}.  
%% Whereas standard methods employ a Monte Carlo method for random search, GALE applies data mining techniques that analyze the structure of the data before selecting just a few candidates to evaluate as the basis of reasoning.

%% \subsection{GALE}

%% GALE stands for Geometric Active Learning Evolution and it is an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm (EMOO, or MOEA).  MOEAs employ population management techniques to first generate a completely random initial population (of size $N$).  The members of the population are "candidates" which consist of possible inputs to the model being optimized.  When that candidate sends its inputs to the model for evaluation, that candidate acquires its fitness score which consists of the objective outputs from the model running on those inputs.

%% Standard MOEA tools are stochastic search methods which explore the input space randomly in search of inputs which optimize the objectives.  Two of the most popular MOEA tools are NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afastafast}, and SPEA2~\cite{zit02} (according to Ammar and Sayyad~\cite{sayyad13c}).  Those two search tools are much like any other search tool from the literature and they require $2N$ evaluations per iteration (an "evaluate everyone" policy).  That number is twice the population size because MOEA tools generally "reproduce" by creating an offspring population which is mutated and passed through biologically-inspired crossover and mutation operators.  To manage the population and retain its size, both the parent and offspring populations are evaluated in order to "sort" (the main feature for NSGA-II and SPEA2), the population and cull the least desired (worst fitness) members.  MOEA tools repeat this process for a number of iterations until some stopping criteria tells the tool to stop.  

%% GALE, on the other hand, is a much faster technique which applies data mining techniques to analyze the population of candidates (in its input space) to cluster them and select a small subset of the most interesting candidates.   Those candidates are then mutated directionally (as opposed to randomly) in a desirable direction.  The end result is that GALE requires only $2Log_2(N)$ evaluations per iteration.  In this section, only a very high level overview of GALE was given.  In the next section, GALE is detailed on an algorithmic level and pseudo-code is also given.  

%% \subsection{Further Technical Details for GALE}

%% GALE combines \emph{active learning}, \emph{spectral learning} and \emph{directed mutation} into search:

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Active Learning is an umbrella term for learning the most from using the least.  In Machine Learning, the labeling of data (such as evaluating candidates) is an expensive operation and the aim is to reduce the number of labeling operations performed~\cite{Dasgupta_atutorial}.  In theory, labeling subsets of the data may yield performances that are just as good (or close to) as labeling the entire dataset.  Hence, active learning seeks to find minimal subsets that yield maximal performance results.  Active Learning has previously been applied to MOEAs in~\cite{Zuluaga:13} to reduce the number of required evaluations of the search tool, however their algorithm is complex to understand and involves the use of Gaussian Processes to predict evaluation outcomes.
%% \item Spectral learners re-express $d$-dimensional data in terms of the $e$ eigenvectors of that data.
%% That is, raw dimensions are expressed in terms of the spectral dimensions~\cite{KamvarKM03}.  The spectral dimensions offer more meaningful information; they describe the variance in the data.  To obtain those spectral dimensions however, an expensive $O(n^3)$ operation can make spectral learners very slow for larger datasets.
%% To offset that, the Nystrom Method~\cite{nystromoriginal} is used to find a lower-rank approximation of the dataset.  While Spectral Learning has a wide-application radius~\cite{Cortes09learningnonlinear},\cite{Fine:2002:EST:944790.944812},\cite{_sparsekernel},\cite{JMLR:v14:talwalkar13a}, the specific field of interest for GALE is Spectral Clustering, as in~\cite{FowlkesBCM04},\cite{Ng01onspectral}, \cite{BachJordan2003}. 
%% \item Directed Mutation is an approach to perturbing candidates from populations of a MOEA search tool.  Typical stochastic methods use standard mutation (as biologically inspired) to randomly change the candidate.  Random mutation can generate poor candidates and only a few strong candidates.  Instead of mutating randomly, a directed approach first approximates a preferred direction for mutation and then directs candidates in that direction for improvement.
%% \end{itemize}

%% GALE begins with an initial population which is randomly generated.  In its iterative phase, that population is clustered via the WHERE~\cite{me12d} spectral learner.  WHERE clusters the population via a recursive descent approach similar to Boley's Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP) algorithm~\cite{boley98}.  PDDP finds principal components (e.g. the directions of most variance, e.g. the spectral dimensions) and splits the data in half along the first principal component.  The WHERE tool is different than PDDP in that WHERE uses a Nystrom Method to simplify the operation to find principal components.  For each half of the split, the procedure is repeated until the parts are within some threshold; the parts are then called leafs.

%% An important detail of WHERE is in the Nystrom Method used; elements of the dataset are projected onto just the first principal component via the FastMap tool~\cite{Faloutsos1995}, (Platt certifies that FastMap is a Nystrom method~\cite{Platt05fastmap}); as such, FastMap is a tool with near-linear complexity as opposed to a tool with cubic complexity.  To see just how simple FastMap is, the lines below summarize the algorithm:

%% \bi
%%   \item Given a population of data points,
%%   \item Pick any point $x$ at random.
%%   \item Let {\em east} be the furthest point from $x$.
%%   \item Let {\em west} be the furthest point from {\em east}.
%%   \item Let the line ($east$, $west$) be the first spectral dimension. 
%% \ei

%% All the data points are then projected onto that first spectral dimension via a law of cosines that maps the point directly to the line to form a right-angle between it and the line:

%% \bi
%% 	\item For each point, x\footnote{x (and any other point) is a vector of dimension n, where n is the number of inputs to the model being optimized}
%% 	\item Let $a = dist(x, east)$
%% 	\item Let $b  = dist(west, x)$
%% 	\item Let $c = dist(east, west)$
%% 	\item $x' = (a^2 + c^2 - b^2)/(2c)$
%% \ei

%% Active learning comes into play during FastMap: only the $east$, $west$ pairs of data points are evaluated.  After WHERE splits the line between $east$, $west$ in half, only one half is further explored (unless WHERE is run without pruning).  Reducing the number of evaluations in GALE is key, so WHERE is run with pruning.  The half which is suppressed from further exploration is the half containing the one of $east$,$west$ which is a weaker candidate (according to its fitness).  To determine which of $east$,$west$ is the weaker candidate, \emph{Continuous Domination}\footnote{For details on Continuous Domination, refer to section 3.1 of Zitzler \&  K\"unzli for their IBEA algorithm~\cite{Zitzler04indicator-basedselection}.} is used to calculate an overall "loss in quality" between the pair of points and the point which losses the least is preferred as the stronger candidate.

%% To visualize the WHERE tool,~\fig{cluster1} demonstrates the recursive division of 400 instances of data; in the first part of that figure, all halves of the data are explored like a complete binary tree.  In the other part of that figure, the exploration of some halves are suppressed and fewer leafs are returned.  Overall pseudo-code of WHERE is given in~\fig{whereCode}.

%% The results from~\cite{galepaper}, ~\cite{krallphd} suggest that GALE is a very effective tool for optimization and can outperform NSGA-II and SPEA2, thus making GALE a good fit even for small models which run fast with any search tool.  For the large models, GALE was much faster, boasting speedups greater than 100 times faster.  In this paper, it is noted that GALE was a necessary tool for further exploring CDA due to the runtime constraints of the model.  Instead of six months of calendar time to run just one of NSGA-II or SPEA2, GALE can do the same job at the same quality in just 83 hours.  In the next section, the CDA model is discussed before moving on to experimental procedures.

\section{Results}
\subsection{ Results with Opportunistic CCM}
\fig{all} summarizes
the results.
As an aid to help visualization, bar graphs are added to each column (and the bar with the largest, smallest value shows the max,min values in the column).
GALE's decisions are shown at the top.
Beneath that, we show two sets of objective scores:
\bi
\item {\em The baseline runs} which are the average objective scores seen without using GALE (just from randomly selecting input decisions).
\item {\em The treated runs} which are the average final objective scores seen after 20 runs of GALE.
\ei
For the tables of objective results:
\bi
\item The controlled value (HTM, maximum human task load) is shown on the left hand side of the table.
\item The values in the other columns are all counts per simulated minute.
\ei
When reading these results, it is insightful to look for {\em saturation}, {\em trends}, {\em absences} and {\em cliffs}. 


\subsubsection{Saturation}

Values {\em saturate} when they are driven towards their theoretical maximum. 
In the case of the CDA objectives, any {\em Time} objective that occurs at 60 seconds per minute is {\em saturated}. 
Such saturation can be observed in the {\em avg Interrupted Time} and the {\em avg Delayed Time} values of 60 at  $\mathit{HTM}=1$ in \fig{all}b .

In terms of a pilot maintaining safe operations, saturation is highly undesirable. At saturation, a pilot is permanently interrupted for all tasks so everything gets delayed.  
Note that this saturation result satisfies  one of our {\em sanity checks} (that less HTM leads to more problems).

The good news is that saturation can be avoided. 
In \fig{all}b, we see that the simulated pilots following GALE's advice never
reach saturation at $\mathit{HTM}=1$.
GALE advises the simulated pilots to restrict themselves to only the most important tasks (in CDA's model, this means operating in {\em opportunistic} mode) and to allow the automation to handle all or most of the tasks that the automation can handle.
Note that this  means that our experiment satisfies  another {\em sanity check} (that GALE can learn mitigations to the low HTM problems).



\subsubsection{Trends}

{\em Trends} are  values that change  smoothly with changes to HTM. For example, the  {\em num Forgotten Acts} per minute is low in all results until HTM falls below four (after which time it can spike to alarmingly large values). 

With one exception, this trend holds for all objectives---which is to say that airplane safety is critically dependent on this HTM value.

The exceptions to this trend are the GALE results of \fig{all}b.  
In those rows, GALE could learn mitigations that compensate for pilots struggling to control. 
Those mitigations are shown in \fig{all}a. 
 

\subsubsection{Absence}

Several columns in \fig{all}a contain nearly all zero values. That is they are mostly {\em absent} from the recommendations made by GALE.

\bi
\item
A {\em MIX}ed level of autonomy was rarely useful, suggesting that the simulated pilots should very rarely program the computer to handle only some of the airplane instructions.
\item
Similarly, the {\em STR} strategic cognitive control mode was also rarely used.
From this result, we say that, in this model, pilots should avoid cycling through all of the available monitoring tasks while trying to anticipate future tasks.
\item Other absent columns can be seen in the scenarios GALE found it could handle. 
GALE's recommendations to the simulated pilot could handle all the {\em Scenario}s (see all the non-zero numbers in the {\em Scenario} columns of \fig{all}b).
\ei


\subsubsection{Cliffs}

{\em Cliffs} are values that change sharply between one HTM value and the next; there are two large cliffs in \fig{all}.

The first cliff relates to {\em Level of Autonomy}. 
At $\mathit{HTM}=1$, GALE nearly always selected for a {\em HIGH} level of autonomy. 
However, as soon as pilots can do or hold in memory two things at once (at $\mathit{HTM}>1$), that recommendation no longer holds.  
In fact, for all levels of $\mathit{HTM}>1$, GALE usually prefers for the pilot to process flight data and program the computer (i.e. to use the {\em MOST} approach).
\ADD{Another way to say this is that, when their attention is failing, our simulated human pilots should give more tasks to the machines.}
However, at any other time, it is better to guide, and not be guided by, the automatic systems.

The other cliff in these results is seen in the right-hand-side columns of \fig{all}a. 
In those results, it can be seen that for  $1 \le \mathit{HTM} \le 3$ the {\em OPP} (opportunistic) cognitive control mode is most often selected by GALE. 
However, above that point (for $\mathit{HTM}>3$), it is rarely selected.
This cliff is a large enough effect in  a critical range of the model to deserve special attention.
Accordingly, Experiment \#2 (discussed below) explores the the relative merits of opportunistic control versus other modes.

\subsection{Results with Dsiabling  Opportunistic CCM}
As shown in \fig{all}a, at low HTM levels of $\mathit{HTM}<4$, most of GALE's recommended actions use the opportunistic cognitive control mode (where pilots monitor and perform tasks related to only the most critical functions). 
To see if this was  an important effect, we repeated the above experiment with this opportunistic mode disabled.

The results are shown in \fig{some}.  
In those results, the following aspects are noteworthy:
\bi
\item Comparing the {\em baseline} and {\em GALE} distributions of  \fig{some}b, we see that the GALE treatment barely changes the baseline distributions. 
That is, if GALE cannot use the opportunistic control mode, then it cannot mitigate for low HTM values.
\item
Comparing the {\em Scenario} results in \fig{some}a to \fig{all}a, we see that when we cannot use opportunistic mode there are more absent columns in {\em LATE} and {\em WIND}.
That is, if GALE cannot use opportunistic control, then it cannot find another mitigation for late arrival or high wind conditions.
\ei
From these results, we say that opportunistic mode is an essential tool for combating the problems associated with low HTM in the CDA model.

%% solutions where we found best spread over varions scanarios

%% opp most important at low htm

%% The primary interest in this study was to explore the limitations of the pilots in the cockpit during approach to runway of a continuous descent profile (as in RQ1).  This section walks the reader through each experimental half (Including and Excluding Opportunistic), and each of the research questions are addressed as discussions become available for them.

%% \subsection{Half \#1: Including Opportunistic}

%% In~\fig{res1}, final and averaged objective scores (for each of the 20 repeats) are shown for the "Including Opportunistic CCM" half of experiments.  The objective scores should all be minimized for these experiments and orange bars are 'per-column'; the largest bar in each column represents the worst score for that column.  The bottom table represents the results after GALE was used to optimize those objective scores and the upper table represents the baseline objective scores without any optimization.  Those baselines were collected by running CDA a thousand times with randomized inputs (within respectively viable input ranges).

%% The message from~\fig{res1} is very clear: GALE was able to optimize those objective scores very impressively.  Even in the face of low HTM (which represents a workload that very highly exceeds pilot limitations), GALE was able to find inputs that could optimize the objectives.

%% The expectation prior to running GALE was met in the baselines: the objective scores were improved with higher HTM.  This addresses RQ1 and suggests that HTM directly has an effect on each of the objectives.  However, the GALE results confounded that expectation with a bell-shaped curve 'bump' occurring around HTM = 4.  This bump sparked an interest to further explore CDA by creating the "Excluding Opportunistic CCM" half of experiments, fueled by a hunch that the opportunistic CCM was the reason behind very strong GALE results across the objective scores.

%% Indeed, the story told by~\fig{res2} confirms that hunch.  That figure pulls out the inputs found by GALE to optimize the objective scores shown back in~\fig{res1}.  Each input is separated by input at the top level and then by possible value for that input at the second level.  Each row shows the percentage of inputs used for different levels of HTM.  A quick look at the Cognitive Control Mode (CCM) shows an identifiable trend where opportunistic (OPP) is chosen a vast majority of the time at low (1-3) levels of HTM, and then there is a paradigm shift at mid levels of HTM and higher (4-8).

%% %It is curious as to why results would be good at the extreme settings of low or high HTM, but not so well at medium HTM.  To explore that,~\fig{res2} shows the recommendations that GALE was making in its optimization of the objective scores.  For each set of columns (Level of Autonomy, Scenario and Cognitive Control Mode), each possible decision input is listed and the values shown in each row are the percentage of times that decision was recommended by GALE.  For instance, in the first row for HTM fixed to 1, the level of autonomy was set to "HIGH" 88\% of the time, and only 12\% of the time was it set to "MOST", and was never set to "MIX". 

%% This suggests that for RQ3, which explores the effect of changed CCM, that the lazier opportunistic mode is essential for optimizing objectives at lower HTM.  For higher HTM, opportunistic is less essential and tactical CCM is preferred instead.

%% Another identifiable trend from~\fig{res2} is in the level of autonomy input (function allocation, or FA).  For the lowest HTM (HTM = 1), the level of autonomy should be "HIGH" and other than that, it is clear that the "MOST" input value be used instead.  This makes sense, since at lower pilot HTM, the pilot is unable to keep up with the taskload pace, and there should be more automation to supplement that cognitive limitation.  This gives some insight into RQ2 and suggests that less autonomy for lower HTM could lead to larger backlogs of missed, delayed and forgotten tasks.

%% %Those decision recommendations of GALE show two very interesting trends.  Firstly, there is a clear trend in the level of autonomy for HTM settings of 1, where "HIGH" is very highly used, and otherwise, the "MOST" mode is used the most.  Secondly, for low HTM (1 to 3), the Cognitive Control Mode was generally preferred to be set to OPP (Opportunistic Mode).  Those two trends are outlined in bolder borders in~\fig{res2}.  To recap, the level of autonomy refers to the amount of work the computer does in the cockpit, and the cognitive control mode (CCM) refers to the monitoring behavior of the human pilot.  The OPP mode is a behavior mode where the human pilot is very relaxed and does not monitor flight activities very often, as opposed to TAC and STR which monitor flight activities increasingly more often.  At HTM settings of 4 or higher, the OPP mode was deferred and  TAC (Tactical) was preferred instead.

%% \subsection{Half \#2: Excluding Opportunistic}

%% Previously in the last subsection regarding the first half of experimentation, for RQ3, it was hypothesized that opportunistic CCM was essential to optimize the objectives.  To provide evidence of that, the opportunistic CCM was disabled and only tactical or strategic CCM was allowed for this second half of experiments.

%% The expectation is that without the opportunistic CCM, the objective scores cannot be optimized nearly as well as when opportunistic CCM is included.  In~\fig{res3}, which follows the same format as~\fig{res1}, that expectation is realized.  For low levels of HTM (1 to 3), GALE was unable to significantly improve objective scores from the baselines; the orange bars are basically unchanged in size (between baselines and GALE results).  For mid to high levels of HTM, the objective scores were already very low in the baselines and no optimization was needed - suggesting that random decision selection is satisfactory whenever there are little to no cognitive limits.

%% Going further, a look at the decisions recommended by GALE whenever OPP was disabled is shown in~\fig{res4}; there was no trend found for level of autonomy and the only decision GALE could tweak to find any performance increase at all was the scenario (but scenario is an uncontrollable decision in nature).  The CCM was locked in on tactical mode and strategical mode was hardly ever considered. 

\section{Discussion}

In principle, all the above conclusions could have been reached using an MOEA like NSGA-II. 
However, in practice, that would have been impractically slow. 
To understand why, we must review the systems-level tasks associated with conducting this kind of study.
{\em Commissioning} this CDA model took several months as one of us (Krall) worked inside the NASA firewalls to port the CDA model to the NASA servers. 
In that process, CDA was run many times to ``iron out the bugs''.  
Often it was necessary to trace through the evaluations to determine what was
going astray. 
During this period, we were grateful that GALE was only making $O(log(N))$ evaluations per generation since the $O(2N)$ evaluations used by standard optimizers would have led to an overwhelming amount of data.

Also note that after commissioning the model came {\em generating conclusions}.
This required 20 repeats of all models for baselines and with GALE, repeated for HTM set from one to eight, then repeated twice
with and without the opportunistic CCM.
With GALE, those runs took 83 hours and with NSGA-II, those runs would have taken much longer.
Based on some samples we made of NSGA-II performing parts of running with the opportunistic CCM, we estimate that if NSGA-II was used for the above experiments, then that would have taken 6 months.


As to the external validity of this work,
all the conclusions made here came from two tools: the CDA model and GALE. 
If these tools are somehow distorted or biased then our conclusions would be distorted or biased in the same manner.
That said,
there is enough  prior work on CDA and GALE  to make the case that it useful to study the CDA model with the GALE optimizer.
We note that these tools are the products of years of research and much analysis and testing ~\cite{Kim2011,Pritchett2011,Feigh2012,Kim2013,Pritchett2013,Pritchett2014, Feigh2014, krall14aaai,krallphd,galepaper}. 
Given the resources spent on its construction, it seems prudent and timely to learn what we can from that model.

%% Also, as to GALE, this algorithm uses a guided $log(N)$ heuristic to explore a space of $O(2N)$ possible comparisons (for details on this approach, see \tion{gale}). 
%% A pre-experimental concern with such an approach is that that this partial explanation of such a large space might miss some important details. Hence, this issue was extensively explored, using two dozen models, in Krall's thesis~\cite{krallphd}. 
%% In short, compared to $O(2N)$ algorithms such as NSGA-II~\cite{deb00afast}, GALE rarely performed worse and often performed better. 




\section{Conclusion}

A common, and naive, assumption made by researchers who have not conducted model-based experiments is this: once the model is built, then inference is easy.

We have shown in this paper that, for large and complex models, this naive assumption may not hold.
In fact, it is critically important to consider {\em how} that inference is conducted.
This paper endorses the use of modeling for complex studies, but it also addresses a few issues that must also be handled whenever learners are used in conjunction with models.  

Firstly, there is a need to develop and commission the model for integration
with the learner tools.  
This can be a time-intensive task and moreover, additional modifications can be cause for restarting the actual experimentation which follows thereafter.  

Secondly, the learners themselves are complex computational intelligence software tools which have been the subject of decades of research.  
The selection and deployment of just a single tool can become a complex decision
process.  
Moreover, high model runtimes can restrain the space of usable learning tools by a vast amount as much of the research on those learners has focused on optimizing very small models.  

In this paper, GALE was used because it can optimize very large models.  
This sort of enabling technology is made possible because GALE does not need to run the models as often as other learning tools (specifically, GALE performs $O(log(N))$ evaluations while standard methods explore a space of $O(2N)$ options).
GALE can quickly generate conclusions from complex models. 
For example, in the case study explored here we offer the following answers to the research questions posed in the introduction.




\subsection{RQ1: Safety and Low HTM}
We say that unsafe operation occurs if pilots cannot complete their assigned tasks.
For little to no cognitive limitations (HTM is 4 or higher), there is very little effect on taskload completion times.  
The reason for this is simple: if the pilot can perform all tasks as they come, then there should not be any backlog of delayed tasks.  
For lower levels of HTM, there were many delays and interruptions noted for our simulated pilots. 
Hence, we conclude that low HTM levels are especially dangerous within this model.

\subsection{RQ2: Impact of Automation}

For nearly all levels of HTM, it was sufficient to rely on a {\em MOST} level of autonomy where the pilot is in charge of processing input and programming the cockpit computers.
However, in extreme situations ($\mathit{HTM}=1$), that recommendation is not supported.  
For such very low levels of HTM, our simulated pilots should switch to {\em HIGH} levels of automation to ensure aircraft safety.
\begin{changed}
This recommendation intuitively makes sense if we assume that the automation works as the pilot intends
and that the pilot understands how it works.
 We note that the creators of WMC have  published a study with a version of their model tuned to study automation surprise~\cite{Gelman2014}.
\end{changed}

\subsection{RQ3: Pilot Monitoring Policies}

As to appropriate cognitive control modes for watching over an aircraft, for higher levels of HTM, it was sufficient to step up to the tactical control mode (which allows the pilot to monitor more of the aircraft flight procedures).
For lower levels of HTM, tactical flight operations proved to be too much for our
simulated pilot to handle and opportunistic control mode was essential to mitigate against low HTM.

\begin{changed}
More validation should be done before applying the recommendations we make here for the CDA model to the real-world safety problems that have inspired both CDA and this study.
Accidents such as Air France 447~\cite{AirFranceFinal2012} and 
Asiana Flight 214~\cite{AsianaFinal2014} show that
the pilots became distracted by off-nominal behavior, and {\em failed to monitor} the most important flight state information (e.g. airspeed, altitude and attitude).
When stressed, pilots are asked to do something very like the opportunistic mode as implemented within the CDA model---worry about the key monitoring and flight tasks first.
\end{changed}



%% Secondly, the results of applying GALE to the CDA
%% model for aircraft approaches are given in this
%% paper.  Those results can lead to large discussions,
%% but the general message is as follows: cognitive
%% limitations can be a serious detriment to taskload
%% completion times.  It is not a far stretch to
%% believe that high taskload completion times can lead
%% to decreased safety guarantees.  Moreover, a look
%% into the mitigations required to get around those
%% cognitive limitations shows that pilots rely on
%% automation within the aircraft whenever they cannot
%% handle the size of the taskload.  This point
%% combined with the most recent of aircraft accidents
%% raises an alarm because recent crashes have been the
%% result of over-dependence on autonomous agents when
%% those agents have been disabled or malfunctioning
%% during the approach.  Without the experience to land
%% the aircraft without the aid of the autonomous
%% agents, the pilot is faced directly against
%% cognitive limits and inexperience.

\subsection{Assembling the CDA Model}

The CDA model as used for the study required some integration with the search tools used in this paper and it was not ready-made for the task at hand.  The Work Models that Compute (WMC) framework had already implemented CDA but inputs and outputs had to first be selected to define the CDA model as a "problem instance" that the search tool can "solve".  This integration was performed by the first author of this paper during a summer internship with NASA Ames Research Center; WMC and the CDA model remains a Georgia Tech proprietary model accessible only via remote-access servers that connect to the machines located at NASA Ames.

CDA is just one "work" model contained within the Work Models that Compute (WMC) framework, with major contributors~\cite{Kim2011,Pritchett2011,Feigh2012,Kim2013,Pritchett2013}.  

Hence, CDA is a complex model that takes about 8 seconds to run.  That runtime was measured from a NASA Ames Linux server running on a 2.4gGHz Intel Core i7, with 8GB of memory.

Analysts at NASA have a lot of scenarios they would like to explore with CDA.  Given standard MOEAs like NSGA-II or SPEA2, that exploration would require 300 weeks to complete.  With GALE however, that time can be considerably shrunk, so the CDA model is an excellent candidate to demonstrate the true potential of such an active learner.
